Consens SharpView
=================


Description
-----------
This utility provides an alternative to Consens WebView that runs locally and
doesn't require Java. In addition it has the option to store the password which
allows auto-logon.

Build
-----
To avoid legal issues, none of the required libraries are included. So in order
to build the program, first create a folder named `lib` at the same location
where the project file resides.
Then place all [IKVM](http://www.ikvm.net/download.html) DLLs into that folder,
i.e. all `IKVM.*.dll` files.
Now compile the ULC Java Applet files to *.NET*. This is done by first copying
`ulc-base-client.jar`, `ulc-applet-client.jar`, `ulc-servlet-client.jar` and
`consens-ulc-extension.jar` from your Consens installation into a folder on the
development machine. Open a command prompt within that folder, execute

    ikvmc.exe -out:Consens.dll -target:library ulc-base-client.jar ulc-applet-client.jar ulc-servlet-client.jar consens-ulc-extension.jar

and place the generated `Consens.dll` into the project's `lib` folder.
Finally, build the project with Visual Studio or msbuild just as usual.

Usage
-----
The program takes three parameters: The first one is the base URL of ZcWebView,
which usually simply is `http://<server>:<port>/`. The second parameter allows
to set or override the user name, the third to additionally provide a password,
which is not recommended. Usually, only the first parameter should be supplied.

If a user has stored his or her password and wants to logon with a different
name, the program can be started while holding the `SHIFT` key, which brings
up the logon dialog again.
